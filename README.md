# System_to_Check_the_Healthiness_of_Earthing_System
This project monitors the health of earthing systems in electrical poles using sensors for earth resistance, leakage current, and continuity. It uses Arduino/ESP32 with ADS1015, ACS712, and a 16x4 LCD, sending data to a central system for real-time monitoring and fault detection.
